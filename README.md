# GeoDeep

A fast, lightweight Python library for AI object detection in geospatial rasters (GeoTIFFs). 

> :warning: This library is a work in progress.

## Install

```bash
pip install -U geodeep
```

## Usage

Check the [documentation](https://geodeep.readthedocs.io/).

## Why GeoDeep?

Compared to other software packages (e.g. [Deepness](https://github.com/PUTvision/qgis-plugin-deepness)), GeoDeep relies only on two dependencies, `rasterio` and `onnxruntime`. This makes it simple and lightweight.
