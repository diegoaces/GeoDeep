# GeoDeep

A fast, lightweight Python library for AI object detection in geospatial rasters (GeoTIFFs). 

Its main advantage over other software packages (e.g. [Deepness](https://github.com/PUTvision/qgis-plugin-deepness)) is that it depends only on two packages, `rasterio` and `onnxruntime`. This makes it both simple and lightweight.

> :warning: This library is a work in progress.

## Install

```bash
pip install -U geodeep
